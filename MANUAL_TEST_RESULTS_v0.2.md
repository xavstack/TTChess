## Known Issues to Address

1. **Difficulty Scaling** (Priority: Medium)
   - User feedback: "not completely convincing"
   - Action needed: Calibrate skill/depth/movetime presets
   - Location: `src/engine/types.ts` PRESETS

2. **Piece Sets** (Priority: Low)
   - PNG assets not loading
   - Currently using Unicode with per-set styling
   - Location: `src/utils/pieceSets.ts`

3. **Manual Test Coverage** (Priority: Low)
   - Only ~45/89 tests performed
   - Remaining tests cover: Accessibility, Mobile Responsiveness, Error Handling, End-to-End

---

## Next Steps for Complete Testing

1. **Re-run critical path tests** after each major change
2. **Complete accessibility testing** (keyboard nav, screen readers)
3. **Mobile testing** on actual devices
4. **Cross-browser testing** (Firefox, Safari)
5. **Performance testing** (animation smoothness, load times)
6. **Error handling** (malformed PGN, localStorage corruption, etc.)
