## üö® Failure Handling

**If ANY item above fails:**

1. **STOP** all development work
2. **IDENTIFY** the root cause of the failure
3. **FIX** the configuration or dependency issue
4. **VERIFY** the fix by re-running the checklist
5. **ONLY THEN** proceed with development

## üìù Common Issues & Solutions

### Tailwind CSS Not Working

- **Symptom:** UI appears as unstyled HTML
- **Solution:** Ensure `tailwind.config.js` and `postcss.config.js` exist
- **Verify:** Check that Tailwind classes are applied in browser dev tools

### Build Failures

- **Symptom:** `npm run build` fails
- **Solution:** Check TypeScript configuration and fix type errors
- **Verify:** Run `npm run typecheck` first

### Test Failures

- **Symptom:** `npm run test` fails
- **Solution:** Check test configuration and fix failing tests
- **Verify:** Ensure all dependencies are installed

### Development Server Issues

- **Symptom:** `npm run dev` fails or serves broken UI
- **Solution:** Check Vite configuration and restart server
- **Verify:** Clear browser cache and reload

## üìã Quick Verification Commands

Run these commands to quickly verify setup:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Check TypeScript
npm run typecheck

# Check linting
npm run lint

# Run tests
npm run test

# Build project
npm run build

# Start dev server
npm run dev
```

All commands should complete without errors for a properly configured project.
