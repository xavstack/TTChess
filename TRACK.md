# Progress Log

- M0: Project scaffolded with Vite React+TS; deps installed; Tailwind wired.
- M0: Rules/docs created (README, PLAN, TRACK, DECISIONS, CONTRIBUTING); Cursor rules hardened for YOLO.
- M1: Vertical slice complete — SVG board, user move, AI reply, taunt TTS (debounce/cancel); initial unit tests green.
- M2: Engine worker + difficulty presets wired into store/UI; current fallback move selection (random) until Stockfish WASM asset is packaged locally per constraints.
- M3: UI/UX — Framer Motion move animation; PGN import/export; undo pair; board flip; theme toggle; basic clocks (5+0) with ticking.
- M4: PWA manifest/icons added; runtime caching configured; production build successful.
- M5: High-contrast theme; tests expanded (TTS debounce/cancel; store sync); cleanup; no console errors.
- CRITICAL FIX: Added missing Tailwind CSS configuration files (tailwind.config.js, postcss.config.js) - UI was rendering as unstyled HTML due to missing PostCSS processing.
- GUARDRAILS: Enhanced .cursor/rules with comprehensive configuration guardrails and development setup checklist to prevent future omissions.
- DOCS: Updated CONTRIBUTING.md and README.md with clear setup requirements and troubleshooting guidance.
- CHECKLIST: Created DEV_SETUP_CHECKLIST.md with mandatory verification steps for all configuration files and build processes.
- DOCS CLEANUP: Consolidated redundant fix documentation (LAYOUT_FIX_ANALYSIS.md, LAYOUT_FIX_SUMMARY.md, TAILWIND_FIX_SUMMARY.md, FIX_STATUS.md) into this TRACK.md entry to reduce duplication and token waste.
- VOICE SYSTEM: Added Voice Lab dev tool for voice selection and custom audio URL overrides; refactored TTS with queued speech to prevent interruptions; added reversible gate to disable taunts on AI moves.
- PERFORMANCE: Fixed console "Violation setInterval" spam by throttling clock updates to whole-second boundaries while maintaining smooth display.

- RELEASE: Tagged baseline `V0.1_demo_TTC`.
- MAINTENANCE: Stopped running dev servers; formatted codebase with Prettier; lint pass noted type strictness items for future cleanup.
- DEV SERVER: Preflight blocked start due to Node 22.11.0; engines require Node >=20.19 or >=22.12. Action: upgrade local Node (e.g., 22.12+) before dev.
- PLANNING: Added M6 plan to `PLAN.md` for dashboard menu, variants, move list, coordinates, palettes, gameplay aids, clock redesign, and piece sets.
- ADRs: Recorded decisions ADR-006..ADR-012 covering dashboard overlay, layout constraints, variants strategy, move list/coordinates, themes/piece sets, aids rendering, and clock interaction.
- REFACTOR: Created src/engine/types.ts with typed EngineRequest/EngineResponse protocols; eliminated all 'any' types across engine, store, components, and tests; added @ts-expect-error descriptions per lint rules.
- M6 COMPLETE: All 14 planned features implemented and tested:
  - ✅ Unified Dashboard overlay with hotkey (/) and focus trap
  - ✅ Player nameplates with ≤98vh viewport constraints  
  - ✅ Game variants: Standard, Chess960, King of the Hill, Three-check, Horde
  - ✅ Collapsible SAN move list with jump-to-move functionality
  - ✅ Outside-board file/rank coordinates (toggleable)
  - ✅ 5 board color palettes with persistence
  - ✅ Gameplay aids: arrows and capture circles from Worker
  - ✅ Clock redesign with flip interaction and Space hotkey
  - ✅ 4 piece sets with free Unicode symbols and attribution
  - ✅ All features persist settings and pass tests/build
- BUILD: Production build successful with PWA generation; all tests passing; lint clean.
- COMMIT: Tagged v0.2_unverified with complete M6 implementation ready for code review and manual testing.
- DOCUMENTATION: Created comprehensive code review sheet (CODE_REVIEW_v0.2.md) covering all 14 M6 features, architecture changes, type safety improvements, and risk assessment.
- TESTING: Created detailed manual UI test list (MANUAL_UI_TESTS_v0.2.md) with 84 test cases across 14 feature areas for thorough validation.
